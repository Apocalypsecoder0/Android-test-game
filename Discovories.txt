The Discovories page is basically a daily bonus given to the players.

Every day the players are allowed to pick 3 different discovories. They can not pick the same one twice. 

They get the choice out of
[*] Soilders - % of population (Config Database)
[*] Scientists - % of population (Config Database)
[*] Population - % of population (Config Database)
[*] Land - % of land (Config Database)
[*] Money - x hours from mines (Config Database)
[*] Research - x hours research (Config Database)
[*] Power - % amount of power (Config Database)
[*] Spies - x hours of spy production (Config Database)

Each discovory has a minimum that they can recieve which is also in the database and is configurable. eg. the minimum spies may be 1000 but x hours only gives me 300 therfore I gain 1000 spies instead of 300.
