This bage is basically the browsing part of the game.

As you know the game is based on the structure

Universe -> Galaxies -> Solar systems -> Kingdoms

Well this is the page where you can browse the universe. The system and galaxy should be sessions so that if you were last looking at 2:3 for example next time you go to the solar Sysem page or Probe or missile page the system 2:3 is being displayed. This means there should also be a link to "My System" which takes you back to your system.

You may input the galaxy and solar sysem number in to boxes and then press submit. Once you have it will reload the page and take you to that system.

When viewing a system you can see
[*] Solar System Name
[*] Allaince
[*] Solar System Anouncments
[*] Solar system Treaties

You can also see the kingdoms situation in the system and some of their status such as
[*]Planet name
[*]Status
[*]Coords
[*]Kingdom Type
[*]Amount of Land
[*]Networth

They are also colour coded so you can tell who the leader, vice leader, is and who is in newbie mode, disabled or on vacation.

You should be able to click on the name of each planet and then when you click there is a drop down box of 4 options
[*] Message
[*] Attack
[*] Probe
[*] Missile
