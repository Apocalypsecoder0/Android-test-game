Before the game starts, groups must be created. There is a dedicated page for creating groups and another for joining them.

A group allows players to join the same system with their friends. However, there are limitations to prevent the formation of overly powerful systems and alliances.

Once game signups begin, group creation and signups must cease. This ensures that reserved spots for groups are not occupied or left vacant, maintaining fairness across systems.
