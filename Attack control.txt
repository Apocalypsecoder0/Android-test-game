Here you can choose who to attack and again same rules apply as military intelligence, any system but shows allaince and if its the same allaince, red and bold.

When the play sends out military he can decide how many generals to send out (maximum 4). With each extra general he sends out its 3% bonus.
for example 1 General = no bonus 4 generals = 9% bonus

The player can choose how much military to send of each offensive unit. he can only send out s% of total units (config database). 

Basically if you have more offense points than the defender does, defense points you win. If the attack is successful then the attacker gains
[*] L% land
[*] p% population
[*] m% money
[*] w% power

Military loses are s% for succesful attacks f% for failed attacks. For the defense they are ds% and df%. However there are more values as these values change for each attack type so it is more like

Attack 
- Succesful as%, ms%, rs%
- Fail af%, mf%, rf%
Defender
- Succesful ads%, mds%, rds%
- Fail adf%, mdf%, rdf%

There are also different types of attacks. Above descrived was the assault which is the main type of attack.

There are 2 other type of attacks
[*] Massacre - 3 times the offense points is required - a certain percent of land, pop, money and power gained is destroyed. 
[*] Raid - requires less military. IE send 5% off what is required you get 5% of L% of land... There is a raid limit between l% and h% ef (70% of land and 300% of land)


Return times:

For the main return time you have to remember the coords mentioned in solar system. Imagine the coordinates are in a circle so that the closer together the shorter the return time. 
So if I was in the coordinates 5:5 and someone had the coordinaes 5:5 as well it would be a quick return time. If it is in a different galaxy you add one hour. Using pythagorous the distance between coords is found and then this is added onto a "base" value, x which is in the database giving return time

David Kindly wrote this for us:

<?php

function wrap_distance($ax, $ay, $bx, $by, $gx, $gy) {
	/*
		($ax, $ay) = First coordinate pair
		($bx, $by) = Second coordinate pair
		($gx, $gy) = Grid size
	*/

	# Find direct x and y distances (no wrapping)
	$dx = abs($ax - $bx);
	$dy = abs($ay - $by);

	# Check if wrap distance is smaller
	$dx = Min($gx - $dx, $dx);
	$dy = Min($gy - $dy, $dy);

	# Calculate hypotenuse length
	return sqrt(pow($dx, 2) + pow($dy, 2));
}

?>


The generals split up in return times... so if there is a return time of 9 on a target 
the first general returns after 2 hours, the second after 4, the third after 7 and the fourth after the full 9. They are split evenly as such between the return time etc.

Casualties

I thought I would address casualties...
