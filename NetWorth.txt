Neworth is stored in the database and is only ever calculated when it changes. This should help speed the game up as if its calculaetd every time its viewed its much more often that if its whenever it chaanges.

Networth is calculated by many variables which must be put into a database as configurable so hey can be changed

These are:

Land - 'L' NW per land
Building (including in Construction) - 'B' NW per building
All military units have a different NW so along with configuration for offense and defense and housing space, the NW can also be calcualted
Scientist - 'S' NW per scientist
Population - 'P' NW per population
Money (500) - 'M' NW per 500 money
Spies (1000) - 'SP' NW per 1000 spies
Power - 'Pw' NW per 10000 power
Missiles - 'Mi' NW per missile
