This is the center of control for the allaince leader. This is his base where he can control the allaince. The Assitant allaince leader can also see certain aspects. Each will be mentioned

The first thing is "job" assignment. Only the AL can see this.

There is a pull down box with all the systems in the allaince listed in.
Then below that there is anouther drop down box with all the kingdoms in each respective system in. Then there are 3 buttons

[*] Assign as Assistant Leader
[*] Assign as war leader
[*] Assign as Communication Officer

All of these do just as they say. And give that kingdom the respective role.


The next option is to remove/kick a system out of the allaince. This is a table with the system name in and coordinates, and also the total system networth and the position they lie in the scores.

Next to each system is a tick box titled boot. Once ticked and the form is submitted that system is booted from the allaince.

The next option is simple and easy, the change password for the allaince. Self explanatory and only the allaince leader can access it. They will need to type the old password and then the new and confirm the new password before its changed.

Next option is delete the allaince. The button must be red and they must confirm the submition by typing in the allaince password before submitting the form. Then a pop up JS box asks them if they want to delete. Only accessable by the allaince leader.

Next option is available for AL only and it is to transfer the allaince leadership. Again the AL has to confirm this by typing in the current allaince password.

Next option is a list of allainces. All the other allainces are listed in a drop down box. If the allainces are at war with each other then there is a * by the allaince's name that they are at war with. There must be a red button and a green button. The red button must say Declare War and, yup the green button must say Offer Peace

Next option both the Allaince leader and the Assistant can use. It is View solar system news. There is a drop down box and it has a list of all the solar systems in their allaince. It allows them to view the system news of that solar system.

Next option both allaince leader and the assistant can use. It is a ban from posting in allaince forums thread. It bans a username from posting in the forums for x hours. There is a drop down list of the solar systes and again a drop down box of the kingdoms. And then the amount of time in hours can be selected to ban them for. There will be a max of 72 hours. There is also an unban button
