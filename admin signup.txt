See Signup for main features.

Differences:

[*]To get here they have to type a password and username (also image verification so brute force is impossible)
[*]You can signup here even if singups are closed
[*]It creates an account in a system that is impossible ie. 29:29 This system must be random but must be same for every admin. (ie different sysem every game)
[*]There are no group options as they are in admin group
