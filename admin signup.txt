Admin Signup Process:

1. **Secure Signup**:
   - Admins must enter a valid username and password.
   - Image verification is required to prevent brute force attacks.

2. **Account Creation**:
   - Admins can create accounts even when regular signups are closed.
   - Accounts are created in a unique system (e.g., 29:29), which is randomly assigned but consistent for all admins in a game session.

3. **System Assignment**:
   - The system assigned to admins is different for each game session but remains the same for all admins within that session.
   - Admins do not have group options as they are automatically part of the admin group.
