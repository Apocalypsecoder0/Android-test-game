This is only enabled when signups are closed for a new round. So should be enabled in the admin panel.

All that the user has to give is the email address he will use to sign up to the game with... simple.

He is then sent a random number code 5-10 numbers long. Must be random and this is the unique identifier for the group.

The group is also assigned a system but the user is not shown this. The groups should be spread out as evenly as possible, ie 1 per system and then if there are more... 2 per system etc
