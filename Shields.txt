Every decent place needs shields, in the future anway.

So here we go.

here are 3 things you can dedicate shields to
[*] Spy shields
[*] Missile shields
[*] Military Shields

Each needs power to run... 

On the Shield page they assign power to each thing. This power is used hourly.

The shields max and 
x%,y% and z% resecivly.

This % is how much they add on to their respective fields.

eg. You have 10000 spies in total. Someone spies on you has 11000. Normally he would get through, but if you have full shields (and say x% = 20%) then you have equivilant of 12000 spies so he fails.

With shields its just chances of each nuke getting through. eg 50% and then there is half a chance the nuke will hit.

Military is the same as spies...
