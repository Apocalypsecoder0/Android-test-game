This page basically goes hand in hand with everyhing :D.

Here you can research upgrades. In the configuration table there will have to be a "research" column so that units and buildings can be created which can be researched. They also need to say how many research points are needed. So maybe we can do a column which says research and then if its = to 0 then it doesn need to be researched... however if it is larger than 0 then it has to be researched and cant be accessed until it is researched.

So that sorts out the upgradable for units and buildings.

In the military page you can train scientists. Each scientist gives you 1 research point per hour when assigned to a certain topic. The player must assigned each scientist to a topic. 

Then there are 5 other research points which are not upgrades as such they are just boosts.
They are:
[*] Population Expansion - increases residence capacity
[*] Power boost - increases power capacity and speed
[*] Military Morale - increases offense and defense
[*] Money Bonus - increases overall money after pop bonus etc.
[*] Shields - gives an extra page

In the configuraion table these must have a set maximum % that these can be maxed. This % is how much it improves things. So if you had the max for pop at 30% you could only research 30% as a max of them and this would improve residence capaciy 30%...

However there is a catch... the points needed for these 4 (and only these 4) changes... The forumulea is

land^2 * "x" which is the same as (land*land)*"x". The x must be configured in the database.... When the points needed via this formulea is reached they have reached the max %
