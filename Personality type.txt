All of these personalities are bonuses of some sort but it is much harder to configure. 
I am still not sure whether to hard code these in or whether to make them configurable by the database.

These are things like

[*] Troops return 1 hour quicker
[*] 1% reduction in casualties
[*] 5% extra protection from spies
[*] 5% extra chance spies succeed
[*] Cheaper building costs (10% reduced)
[*] higher chance of random events (more often random events)
