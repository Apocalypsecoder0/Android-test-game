Income is of course the net income of everything.

All the following are configurable in the database
Money per mine
Money per upgradable mine
money per HOUSED population (as pop pay tax)

Therfore the sum of the following is equal to total income

(Mines * Money per mine)+(Upgraded Mines * Money per upgraded mine)+(housed population*Money per population) = Total Money

This is the total income. However rememember that the research "money Bonus" has to be taken into account as well so it would be 

((TotalMoney/100)*Research%)+TotalMoney=TotalIncome
