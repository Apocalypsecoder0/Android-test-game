Each Kingdom type should basically have an advantage and disadvantage which equals out etc...

For a kingdom type these advantages are one of:

[*] Power
[*] Return Times
[*] Research
[*] Populaion
[*] Offense
[*] Defense
[*] Income

They all have a +% or -% of something (or zero of course). All of this should be configurable in a planet configuration table
