Ok this is the forum and the base, of all the other forums

his is a very simple forum which works on a Topic -> Post sort of method.

Each solar system has its own forums where it can discuss things.

Post a new topic (very simple)
[*] Topic Name
[*] Message
[*] SL can make a topic sticky when posting

but the data
[*] Origonal poster
[*] date 
[*] last poster 

must also be kept.

Then there is the list of topics with links above the post a new topic form ordered by date (and sticky ie sticky goes at top). Once a link has been clicked hey get taken to that topic. The posts are arranged newest at the bottom.

For each post you see

Kingdom Name
Solar sysem position

then a new column

date posted
Message
ruler name

Each time a new message is posted the last updated must changed and number of posts must change.

So on the main forum page you should see
[*] Topic Title
[*] Topic Creator
[*] Number of Posts
[*] Last poster
[*] Last updated date time

NOTE: All messages are scanned and seen by galactic court (see galactic court)
